## Overall Exam Readiness Score

Sum your scores for each exercise (max 10 per exercise), then divide by number of exercises:

```
Total Score = (Ex01 + Ex02 + ... + Ex32) / 32
```

| Overall Score | Exam Readiness |
|---------------|----------------|
| **9-10** | 🟢 Ready to test — take mock exams, then real exam |
| **7-8** | 🟡 Good foundation — focus on mock exams, weak areas |
| **5-6** | 🟠 Needs work — complete any <70% exercises, then mock exams |
| **<5** | 🔴 Not ready — rework foundations, gaps too large |

---

## Common Red Flags ⚠️

If you score < 5 on ANY of these exercises, **focus there before mock exams:**

- ✗ Exercise 04 (RBAC) — 25% of exam depends on RBAC
- ✗ Exercise 12 (Storage/PVC) — 10% of exam, PVC behavior misunderstood is critical
- ✗ Exercise 16 (HPA) — target.type confusion common
- ✗ Exercise 28 (NetworkPolicy) — bidirectional requirements confuse many
- ✗ Exercise 32 (Service endpoints) — selector and backend diagnosis need practice
- ✗ Exercise 09 (kubeadm upgrade) — complex, high exam weight

If stuck on these, spend time on them — don't rush to mock exams.
